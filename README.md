# vscode-settings

My personal config files for VSCode.

## Settings

To found VSCode settings.json open command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and type `Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)`.

## Keybindings

To found VSCode keybindings.json open command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and type `Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)`.

## Extensions

There is no built-in way to export/import extensions in VSCode, but you can manage them via terminal.

`install-extensions.sh` script run commands to install extenstions.

To update script use one of the `write-extensions` scripts, according to your system.
